# Mousiki
## What our program will do
Mousiki is a program that will take users information about themselves and will use different music datasets to recommend songs the user may enjoy! The datasets we will be using are Billboard Top 100 and Spotify Tracks. We are currently looking for a third dataset. Users will be able to sign up and sign in to the program. Mousiki users will be able to add songs that the program recommends to playlists.

## How to run
First run open MySQL Workbench and copy and past the db.sql file located in the app folder. Then execute it in MySQL. Next load the datasets by running the load_datasets.py file. Finally run the main.py to use the program.
